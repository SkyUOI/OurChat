//! WIT bindings placeholder
//!
//! The actual WIT bindings should be generated in the plugin itself using:
//! wit_bindgen::generate!({
//!     path: "../plugin/wit/ourchat.wit",
//! });
//!
//! This SDK provides helper traits and types for plugin authors.

// Note: Don't generate bindings here as this is a library, not a plugin component.
// Each plugin should generate its own bindings using wit_bindgen::generate!()
